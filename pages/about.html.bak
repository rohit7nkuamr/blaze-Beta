      <h3>OUR STORY</h3>
      <p>Established in 2018, Blaze Restaurant began with a simple yet powerful vision: to create a dining experience where flavors truly flirt with your taste buds. What started as a small caf√© in Mussoorie has now grown into a beloved culinary destination.</p>
      
      <p>Our founder, Chef Raj Kumar, combined his international culinary training with local Indian flavors to create a menu that bridges tradition and innovation. Each dish tells a story of passion, creativity, and the finest ingredients.</p>
